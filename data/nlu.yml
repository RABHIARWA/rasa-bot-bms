    - Someone forced the main door lock and now it does not close properly.
    - The garbage has not been collected from the hallway for three days and it smells bad.
    - The bedroom window will not open no matter how hard I try, and it seems jammed.

    - The thermostat screen is blank and the heater does not respond to any settings.
    - I have noticed water leaking from the ceiling in the bathroom and it is getting worse.
    - The switch near the fridge sparks every time I turn it on, which is dangerous.
